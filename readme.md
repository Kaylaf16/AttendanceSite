# Attendance Tracker

Attendance Tracker is a useful tool for teachers that allows students to sign in using RFID connected to a Raspberry Pi, that then updates student arrival times into the database. The site allows for a efficient graphical display of students in a specific class, and student arrival times. Teachers are able to sign in and view all classes they are teaching and view the students in those classes.
